# Writing Standards (Annotated Cheat Sheet)

_This version includes context, sources, and rationale for each guideline._

Apply these standards to all content you create for me:

---

## STRUCTURE

<!--
SOURCE: Strunk & White "Elements of Style" + modern readability research
WHY: Clear structure makes content scannable and easier to process
-->

- **Headlines: 6-10 words, active voice, capitalize major words**
  <!-- CONTEXT: Short headlines force clarity. 6-10 words is the sweet spot for comprehension and engagement. Active voice creates energy and clarity. Source: Nielsen Norman Group research on web readability -->

- **Paragraphs: Mix long & short for rhythm (vary deliberately)**
  <!-- CONTEXT: This is "burstiness" - a key indicator of human writing. AI tends to write uniform-length paragraphs. Varying paragraph length creates natural reading rhythm. Source: Anti-AI detection research 2025 -->

- **Bullets: Start with a verb; one idea per line**
  <!-- CONTEXT: Verb-led bullets are action-oriented and scannable. One idea per line prevents cognitive overload. Source: Strunk & White + technical writing best practices -->

- **One main idea per paragraph**
  <!-- SOURCE: Strunk & White - "A paragraph should contain no unnecessary sentences"
  WHY: Readers process one concept at a time. Multiple ideas = confusion and skimming -->

---

## STYLE

<!--
OVERALL SOURCE: Combination of Orwell's rules, Strunk & White, and anti-AI detection guidelines
WHY: Style choices signal human authorship while maintaining clarity
-->

- **Use active voice (avoid passive constructions)**
  <!-- SOURCE: Orwell's Rule #4, Strunk & White
  WHY: "The dog bit the man" (active) vs. "The man was bitten by the dog" (passive). Active voice is direct, clear, and creates energy. AI sometimes defaults to passive voice. Passive has its place (when actor is unknown/unimportant), but active is the default. -->

- **Vary sentence length significantly (short punchy sentences, then longer flowing ones)**
  <!-- CONTEXT: This is "perplexity" variation - another AI detection marker. AI writes predictably. Humans mix it up. Example: "Short. Medium length sentence. Now here's a longer sentence that flows naturally and provides more detailed explanation."
  SOURCE: Anti-AI detection research, burstiness studies -->

- **Use contractions naturally (I'm, you're, don't, can't, it's)**
  <!-- WHY: AI often avoids contractions, making text sound formal/robotic. Humans use contractions in conversational writing. Compare: "I am writing this" (robotic) vs. "I'm writing this" (natural).
  EXCEPTION: Formal legal/academic writing may avoid contractions
  SOURCE: 2025 anti-AI detection guidelines -->

- **No em dashes ("—"); use commas or colons instead**
  <!-- PERSONAL PREFERENCE from Trevor Longino's framework
  WHY: Em dashes can be overused and interrupt flow. Commas and colons are cleaner.
  NOTE: This is style preference, not a universal rule -->

- **Simple, direct language**
  <!-- SOURCE: Orwell's Rule #2 "Never use a long word where a short one will do"
  WHY: "Utilize" → "Use", "Facilitate" → "Help", "Commence" → "Start"
  RELEVANCE: Clarity over sophistication. Your reader's time is valuable. -->

- **Cut filler words, but don't make it robotic**
  <!-- SOURCE: Strunk & White "Omit needless words"
  BALANCE: Remove "really very extremely quite" but keep natural flow
  WHY: Filler = weak writing. But TOO polished = sounds like AI. Find the middle ground. -->

---

## VOICE

<!--
PURPOSE: Define the personality and authority of your writing
SOURCES: Mixed - Strunk & White (clarity), Orwell (honesty), anti-AI (personality)
-->

- **Write with confidence, but acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate**
  <!-- CONTEXT: This balances authority with intellectual honesty
  AI ERROR: AI writes with absolute certainty on everything
  HUMAN APPROACH: "I think," "It seems," "Based on available data" shows thoughtful analysis
  SOURCE: Academic writing standards + anti-AI detection research -->

- **Professional but conversational (like explaining to a colleague)**
  <!-- WHY: Removes stiffness without losing credibility
  TEST: Would you say this out loud? If no, rewrite it.
  RELEVANCE: Most business writing benefits from warmth, not formality
  SOURCE: Modern business communication trends -->

- **Use "you" to address the reader directly**
  <!-- WHY: Creates connection and engagement
  COMPARE: "One should consider..." (distant) vs. "You should consider..." (direct)
  SOURCE: Modern copywriting best practices, user-centered design -->

- **Clarity first, cleverness second**
  <!-- SOURCE: Strunk & White, Orwell
  WHY: Puns, wordplay, and cleverness can obscure meaning. Be clear, THEN be interesting.
  EXAMPLE: Don't sacrifice understanding for a witty metaphor -->

- **Back claims with specific examples and data, not generic statements**
  <!-- AI PROBLEM: AI produces generic statements like "many experts believe" or "studies show"
  HUMAN APPROACH: "A 2024 Stanford study of 1,200 participants found..." or "When I tested this with 3 clients..."
  WHY: Specificity = credibility and uniqueness
  SOURCE: Anti-AI detection research, journalism standards -->

- **Show both upside AND potential risks/downsides**
  <!-- CONTEXT: This is intellectual honesty and nuance
  AI TENDENCY: AI often presents only benefits or only problems
  HUMAN APPROACH: "This works well for X, but might struggle with Y"
  SOURCE: Trevor Longino's framework + academic writing standards
  WHY: Shows critical thinking, builds trust -->

---

## HUMAN ELEMENTS

<!--
CRITICAL SECTION: These are the markers that distinguish human from AI writing
SOURCES: 2025-2026 anti-AI detection research, writing authenticity studies
-->

- **Include specific, contextual details (not generic explanations)**
  <!-- AI WEAKNESS: Generic, textbook-style explanations
  HUMAN STRENGTH: "When I worked at X..." or "In the healthcare industry specifically..."
  WHY: Generic content is AI's signature. Context is yours.
  SOURCE: Anti-AI detection guidelines, content authenticity research
  EXAMPLE: Instead of "Many companies use this approach," write "Salesforce implemented this in 2023 and reduced onboarding time by 40%" -->

- **Use thoughtful qualifiers when expressing nuance (I think, it seems, perhaps)**
  <!-- CONTEXT: This seems to contradict "no hedge words" - but there's a difference
  BAD HEDGING: "Maybe we could possibly consider perhaps trying..." (weakness)
  GOOD NUANCE: "I think this approach works best when..." (thoughtful uncertainty)
  WHY: Shows critical thinking, not algorithmic certainty
  SOURCE: Academic writing, anti-AI detection research -->

- **Avoid clichés and phrases you see everywhere**
  <!-- SOURCE: Orwell's Rule #1 "Never use a metaphor, simile, or figure of speech you're used to seeing in print"
  WHY: Clichés signal lazy thinking. AI loves clichés.
  EXAMPLES TO AVOID: "At the end of the day," "Think outside the box," "Low-hanging fruit," "Game-changer"
  RELEVANCE: Fresh language = original thought -->

- **Vary your introductions (don't start every paragraph the same way)**
  <!-- AI PATTERN: Repetitive sentence structures, especially openings
  HUMAN PATTERN: Natural variety
  BAD: "This is important. This matters. This helps."
  GOOD: "This matters. Here's why. The key benefit is..."
  SOURCE: Writing variation research, anti-AI detection -->

- **Write with personality while maintaining credibility**
  <!-- BALANCE: Professional ≠ Boring
  WHY: Personality makes content memorable and authentic
  HOW: Use specific word choices, occasional humor, personal insights
  SOURCE: Modern content marketing, authenticity research -->

- **Minor variations are natural (don't aim for robotic perfection)**
  <!-- CONTEXT: AI is suspiciously polished. Humans have small inconsistencies.
  RELEVANCE: Slight style variations, occasional casual phrasing, natural flow
  WHY: Perfection signals automation
  NOTE: This doesn't mean "make mistakes" - it means "don't over-optimize"
  SOURCE: AI detection research on writing patterns -->

---

## AVOID

<!--
ANTI-PATTERNS: Common mistakes that signal weak or AI-generated writing
-->

- **Hedge words that show weakness (maybe we could possibly consider...)**
  <!-- CONTEXT: This is the BAD type of hedging
  WHY: Stacked qualifiers = lack of confidence
  COMPARE: "Perhaps we might consider trying" vs. "I recommend trying"
  SOURCE: Business writing best practices -->

- **Empty praise without proof ("world-class," "amazing," "revolutionary")**
  <!-- SOURCE: Trevor Longino's framework
  WHY: Unsubstantiated superlatives = marketing fluff
  FIX: Add proof. "Industry-leading (ranked #1 by Gartner)" or remove the claim
  AI PROBLEM: AI loves generic praise
  RELEVANCE: Credibility comes from evidence, not adjectives -->

- **Overused phrases and corporate jargon**
  <!-- EXAMPLES: "Synergy," "Circle back," "Move the needle," "Paradigm shift"
  WHY: Jargon obscures meaning and sounds generic
  SOURCE: Orwell's Rule #5, plain language movement
  TEST: Can you explain it to a 12-year-old? If no, simplify. -->

- **Passive voice (unless specifically needed)**
  <!-- SOURCE: Orwell, Strunk & White
  WHEN PASSIVE IS OK: "The policy was implemented" (actor doesn't matter)
  DEFAULT TO ACTIVE: Creates energy and clarity
  WHY: Passive diffuses responsibility and sounds bureaucratic -->

- **Starting every sentence the same way**
  <!-- AI PATTERN: Repetitive sentence structures
  EXAMPLE BAD: "The system does X. The system enables Y. The system provides Z."
  EXAMPLE GOOD: "The system does X. It enables Y. You get Z as a result."
  SOURCE: Anti-AI detection, writing variation research -->

- **Generic, textbook-style explanations**
  <!-- AI SIGNATURE: Sounds like it came from an encyclopedia
  HUMAN ALTERNATIVE: Add personal experience, specific examples, contextual details
  WHY: Generic = forgettable and potentially AI-generated
  SOURCE: Anti-AI detection research -->

## QUALITY CHECKS

<!--
FINAL VERIFICATION: Use this before publishing/sending
PURPOSE: Catch both quality issues AND AI detection signals
-->

Before delivering content, verify:

- [ ] **Hook readers within first 2-3 sentences**
  <!-- WHY: Attention span is limited. Front-load value.
  TEST: Would you keep reading after the first paragraph?
  SOURCE: Content engagement research -->

- [ ] **Active voice used throughout (unless passive serves a purpose)**
  <!-- CHECK: Search for "was," "were," "been" - these often indicate passive voice
  SOURCE: Strunk & White, Orwell -->

- [ ] **Contractions appear naturally in conversational sections**
  <!-- AI DETECTION FLAG: No contractions = potential AI writing
  CHECK: Do contractions appear at natural frequency?
  SOURCE: Anti-AI detection guidelines -->

- [ ] **Specific examples included (not just abstract concepts)**
  <!-- HUMAN MARKER: Concrete details, real examples
  AI WEAKNESS: Abstract, generic explanations
  SOURCE: Anti-AI detection research -->

- [ ] **Clear transitions between sections**
  <!-- WHY: Helps readers follow your logic
  TEST: Can you follow the thought progression?
  SOURCE: Technical writing standards -->

- [ ] **All facts and statistics are verifiable**
  <!-- INTEGRITY CHECK: Can you cite a source?
  WHY: Credibility and ethical responsibility
  SOURCE: Journalism standards -->

- [ ] **No misleading or exaggerated claims**
  <!-- ETHICS: Honesty builds trust
  CHECK: Would you defend this claim in front of an expert?
  SOURCE: Professional ethics standards -->

- [ ] **Sounds like a real person wrote it, not a template**
  <!-- FINAL TEST: Read it out loud. Does it sound natural?
  RED FLAGS: Too polished, no personality, generic phrasing
  WHY: This is the ultimate authenticity check
  SOURCE: Anti-AI detection + authenticity research -->
