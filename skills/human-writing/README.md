## How It Works

The skill combines:
- **Classical Writing Principles**: Strunk & White, George Orwell
- **Modern Anti-AI Detection**: 2025-2026 research on human writing markers
- **Professional Standards**: Business communication best practices
- **Trevor Longino's Framework**: Clarity, specificity, balanced perspective

## Key Features

- Varied sentence and paragraph rhythm
- Specific contextual details
- Thoughtful uncertainty where appropriate
- Personal voice and personality

### Professional Standards
- Active voice
- Clear structure
- One idea per paragraph
- Verifiable claims
- Balanced perspective (pros and cons)

### AI Detection Avoidance
- Varies sentence length (burstiness)
- Includes specific examples
- Uses natural language patterns
- Avoids generic explanations
- Shows human personality markers

## Usage Examples

### Simple Request
```
Help me write a professional email to my team about our Q1 results.
```

The skill will automatically apply human writing standards.

### Detailed Request
```
Write a memo about our new policy change:
- Audience: Engineering team
- Tone: Professional but approachable
- Key points: Remote work policy, effective next month, hybrid 3 days/week
- Length: 200-300 words
```

## What Makes This Different

**Traditional AI Output**:
- Robotic, overly polished
