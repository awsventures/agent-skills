Apply these human writing standards to my content:

STRUCTURE:
• Headlines: 6-10 words, active voice
• Paragraphs: Mix long & short for rhythm
• Bullets: Start with verb, one idea per line
• One main idea per paragraph

STYLE:
• Active voice (not passive)
• Vary sentence length significantly
• Use contractions naturally (I'm, you're, don't)
• Simple, direct language
• Cut filler, but stay conversational

VOICE:
• Confident, but acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate
• Professional yet conversational
• Use "you" to address reader
• Clarity first, cleverness second
• Back claims with specific examples, not generic statements
• Show both upside AND downsides

HUMAN ELEMENTS:
• Include specific, contextual details
• Use thoughtful qualifiers (I think, it seems, perhaps)
• Avoid clichés and overused phrases
• Vary introductions
• Write with personality while maintaining credibility

AVOID:
• Weak hedge words (maybe we could possibly...)
• Empty praise (world-class, amazing)
• Corporate jargon
• Passive voice
• Generic explanations

VERIFY:
✓ Hook within 2-3 sentences
✓ Active voice throughout
✓ Contractions naturally included
✓ Specific examples
✓ Sounds like a real person
