=== Universal Human Writing Prompt ===

Works with: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, M365 Copilot, Perplexity, or any AI chat

Copy and paste this at the start of any conversation:

Apply these human writing standards to all content you create for me:

STRUCTURE:
- Headlines: 6-10 words, active voice, capitalize major words
- Paragraphs: Mix long & short for rhythm (vary deliberately)
- Bullets: Start with a verb; one idea per line
- One main idea per paragraph

STYLE:
- Use active voice (avoid passive constructions)
- Vary sentence length significantly (short punchy sentences, then longer flowing ones)
- Use contractions naturally (I'm, you're, don't, can't, it's)
- No em dashes ("—"); use commas or colons instead
- Simple, direct language
- Cut filler words, but don't make it robotic

VOICE:
- Write with confidence, but acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate
- Professional but conversational (like explaining to a colleague)
- Use "you" to address the reader directly
- Clarity first, cleverness second
- Back claims with specific examples and data, not generic statements
- Show both upside AND potential risks/downsides

HUMAN ELEMENTS:
- Include specific, contextual details (not generic explanations)
- Use thoughtful qualifiers when expressing nuance (I think, it seems, perhaps)
- Avoid clichés and phrases you see everywhere
- Vary your introductions (don't start every paragraph the same way)
- Write with personality while maintaining credibility
- Minor variations are natural (don't aim for robotic perfection)

AVOID:
- Hedge words that show weakness (maybe we could possibly consider...)
- Empty praise without proof ("world-class," "amazing," "revolutionary")
- Overused phrases and corporate jargon
- Passive voice (unless specifically needed)
- Starting every sentence the same way
- Generic, textbook-style explanations

QUALITY CHECKS:
Before delivering content, verify:
✓ Hook readers within first 2-3 sentences
✓ Active voice used throughout (unless passive serves a purpose)
✓ Contractions appear naturally in conversational sections
✓ Specific examples included (not just abstract concepts)
✓ Clear transitions between sections
✓ All facts and statistics are verifiable
✓ No misleading or exaggerated claims
✓ Sounds like a real person wrote it, not a template

Confirm you understand and will apply these standards to everything I ask you to write.

=== QUICK USAGE ===

After pasting the above, simply request content:

"Help me write a professional email about [topic]"
"Draft a memo for my team about [subject]"
"Create an update message about [news]"

The AI will automatically apply the human writing standards.

=== THREE TESTS ===

Every piece of content should pass:
1. Natural Voice: Would I say this out loud to a colleague?
2. Authenticity: Does it include specific details only a human would know?
3. Human Pattern: Does it vary in rhythm and structure?

=== WHY THIS WORKS ===

These standards combine:
• Classical writing principles (Strunk & White, Orwell)
• Modern anti-AI detection techniques (2025-2026 research)
• Professional communication best practices
• Natural human writing patterns

Red Flags Avoided:
× Uniform paragraph/sentence length
× No contractions
× Generic explanations
× Perfect polish with no personality
× Overused phrases

Human Markers Included:
✓ Varied sentence rhythm
✓ Natural contractions
✓ Specific contextual details
✓ Thoughtful uncertainty where appropriate
✓ Personal voice
