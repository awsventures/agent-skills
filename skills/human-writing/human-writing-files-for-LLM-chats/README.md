## Examples

### Before (Generic AI)
```
The implementation of this solution is highly recommended. It is important to
consider that this approach provides numerous benefits. Organizations should
evaluate their needs carefully. The system offers world-class performance.
```

### After (Human Writing Standards)
```
I'd recommend implementing this solution. Here's why it works well.

First, it cuts processing time by 40% (tested across three teams). That's
significant. But there's a tradeoff: you'll need two weeks for initial setup.

Is it worth it? For teams processing 100+ requests daily, yes. For smaller
operations, perhaps not.
