## STRUCTURE (Lines 11-14)

- **Headlines: 6-10 words, active voice, capitalize major words** [L11]
  <!-- SOURCE: Strunk & White + Nielsen Norman Group research on web readability -->

- **Paragraphs: Mix long & short for rhythm** [L12]
  <!-- "Burstiness" - key indicator of human writing. AI writes uniform-length paragraphs. -->

- **Bullets: Start with a verb; one idea per line** [L13]
  <!-- Verb-led bullets are action-oriented and scannable. Source: Strunk & White -->

- **One main idea per paragraph** [L14]
  <!-- Strunk & White: "A paragraph should contain no unnecessary sentences" -->

---

## STYLE (Lines 18-23)

- **Use active voice** [L18]
  <!-- SOURCE: Orwell's Rule #4, Strunk & White. "The dog bit the man" > "The man was bitten" -->

- **Vary sentence length significantly** [L19]
  <!-- "Perplexity" variation - AI detection marker. AI writes predictably. Humans mix it up. -->

- **Use contractions naturally** [L20]
  <!-- AI avoids contractions, sounding formal/robotic. "I'm writing" > "I am writing" -->

- **No em dashes; use commas or colons** [L21]
  <!-- Trevor Longino's framework. Em dashes interrupt flow. -->

- **Simple, direct language** [L22]
  <!-- Orwell's Rule #2: "Never use a long word where a short one will do" -->

- **Cut filler words, but don't make it robotic** [L23]
  <!-- Strunk & White: "Omit needless words" - but TOO polished = sounds like AI -->

---

## VOICE (Lines 27-32)

- **Write with confidence, but acknowledge uncertainty** [L27]
  <!-- AI writes with absolute certainty. "I think," "It seems" shows thoughtful analysis. -->

- **Professional but conversational** [L28]
  <!-- TEST: Would you say this out loud? If no, rewrite it. -->

- **Use "you" to address the reader** [L29]
  <!-- "You should consider..." (direct) > "One should consider..." (distant) -->

- **Clarity first, cleverness second** [L30]
  <!-- SOURCE: Strunk & White, Orwell. Don't sacrifice understanding for wit. -->

- **Back claims with specific examples and data** [L31]
  <!-- AI produces generic "many experts believe." Human: "A 2024 Stanford study found..." -->

- **Show both upside AND potential risks** [L32]
  <!-- AI often presents only benefits or only problems. Shows critical thinking. -->

---

## HUMAN ELEMENTS (Lines 36-40)

- **Include specific, contextual details** [L36]
  <!-- AI WEAKNESS: Generic explanations. HUMAN: "When I worked at X..." -->

- **Use thoughtful qualifiers for nuance** [L37]
  <!-- BAD: "Maybe we could possibly consider..." GOOD: "I think this works best when..." -->

- **Avoid cliches and overused phrases** [L38]
  <!-- Orwell's Rule #1. Cliches = lazy thinking. AI loves cliches. -->

- **Vary your introductions** [L39]
  <!-- AI PATTERN: Repetitive structures. BAD: "This is. This matters. This helps." -->

- **Write with personality while maintaining credibility** [L40]
  <!-- Professional ≠ Boring. Personality makes content memorable and authentic. -->

---

## AVOID (Lines 44-49)

- **Hedge words that show weakness** [L44]
  <!-- "Perhaps we might consider trying" > "I recommend trying" -->

- **Empty praise without proof** [L45]
  <!-- SOURCE: Trevor Longino. "World-class" needs proof: "ranked #1 by Gartner" -->

- **Overused phrases and corporate jargon** [L46]
  <!-- "Synergy," "Circle back," "Move the needle" - TEST: Can a 12-year-old understand? -->

- **Passive voice (unless specifically needed)** [L47]
  <!-- Passive OK when actor unknown. Default to active for energy and clarity. -->

- **Starting every sentence the same way** [L48]
  <!-- BAD: "The system does X. The system enables Y." GOOD: "The system does X. It enables Y." -->

- **Generic, textbook-style explanations** [L49]
  <!-- AI SIGNATURE: Sounds like an encyclopedia. Add personal experience, specific examples. -->

---

## QUALITY CHECKLIST (Lines 53-57)

- Hook readers within first 2-3 sentences [L53]
- Active voice used throughout [L54]
- Contractions appear naturally [L55]
- Specific examples included [L56]
- Sounds like a real person wrote it [L57]

---
