# Human Writing Skill

Create clear, professional content that sounds authentically human, not AI-generated.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to write:
- Professional emails and communications
- Business documents and memos
- Any content where AI detection is a concern
- Writing that needs personality while maintaining credibility
- Content that balances authority with natural human voice

## Core Writing Standards

### STRUCTURE

- Headlines: 6-10 words, active voice, capitalize major words
- Paragraphs: Mix long & short for rhythm (vary deliberately)
- Bullets: Start with a verb; one idea per line
- One main idea per paragraph

### STYLE

- Use active voice (avoid passive constructions)
- Vary sentence length significantly (short punchy sentences, then longer flowing ones)
- Use contractions naturally (I'm, you're, don't, can't, it's)
- No em dashes ("—"); use commas or colons instead
- Simple, direct language
- Cut filler words, but don't make it robotic

### VOICE

- Write with confidence, but acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate
- Professional but conversational (like explaining to a colleague)
- Use "you" to address the reader directly
- Clarity first, cleverness second
- Back claims with specific examples and data, not generic statements
- Show both upside AND potential risks/downsides

### HUMAN ELEMENTS

- Include specific, contextual details (not generic explanations)
- Use thoughtful qualifiers when expressing nuance (I think, it seems, perhaps)
- Avoid clichés and phrases you see everywhere
- Vary your introductions (don't start every paragraph the same way)
- Write with personality while maintaining credibility
- Minor variations are natural (don't aim for robotic perfection)

### AVOID

- Hedge words that show weakness (maybe we could possibly consider...)
- Empty praise without proof ("world-class," "amazing," "revolutionary")
- Overused phrases and corporate jargon
- Passive voice (unless specifically needed)
- Starting every sentence the same way
- Generic, textbook-style explanations

## Quality Verification

Before delivering content, verify:

- [ ] Hook readers within first 2-3 sentences
- [ ] Active voice used throughout (unless passive serves a purpose)
- [ ] Contractions appear naturally in conversational sections
- [ ] Specific examples included (not just abstract concepts)
- [ ] Clear transitions between sections
- [ ] All facts and statistics are verifiable
- [ ] No misleading or exaggerated claims
- [ ] Sounds like a real person wrote it, not a template

## How I Apply This Skill

When you request content, I will:

1. **Assess Context**: Understand your purpose, audience, and tone requirements
2. **Apply Structure**: Use varied paragraph rhythm, active voice, proper formatting
3. **Add Human Elements**: Include contractions, specific details, natural variations
4. **Balance Voice**: Maintain professionalism while adding personality
5. **Verify Quality**: Check against the quality checklist above
6. **Ensure Authenticity**: Make sure it sounds like a real person wrote it

## Three Quick Tests

Every piece of content passes these tests:

1. **Natural Voice Test**: Would I say this out loud to a colleague?
2. **Authenticity Test**: Does this include specific details only a human would know?
3. **Human Writing Test**: Does it vary in rhythm and structure?

## AI Detection Red Flags (That I Avoid)

- Uniform paragraph/sentence length
- No contractions
- Generic explanations
- Perfect polish with no personality
- Overused phrases
- Robotic certainty on everything

## Human Writing Markers (That I Include)

- Varied sentence rhythm
- Natural contractions
- Specific contextual details
- Thoughtful uncertainty where appropriate
- Minor stylistic variations
- Personal voice

## Examples

### Generic AI-Style Writing (What I Avoid)

```
The implementation of this solution is highly recommended. It is important to
consider that this approach provides numerous benefits. Organizations should
evaluate their needs carefully. The system offers world-class performance.
```

**Problems**: Passive voice, no contractions, generic statements, empty praise, uniform structure

### Human-Style Writing (What I Produce)

```
I'd recommend implementing this solution. Here's why it works well.

First, it cuts processing time by 40% (tested across three teams). That's
significant. But there's a tradeoff: you'll need two weeks for initial setup.

Is it worth it? For teams processing 100+ requests daily, yes. For smaller
operations, perhaps not.
```

**Strengths**: Contractions, specific data, varied rhythm, acknowledges tradeoffs, natural voice

## Usage Notes

- This skill works for ANY type of professional writing
- It balances classical writing principles (Strunk & White, Orwell) with modern anti-AI detection
- The goal isn't to "trick" detectors, but to write authentically
- Maintains professionalism while adding human personality
