# Human Writing Guidelines

Create clear, professional content that sounds authentically human, not AI-generated.

## Core Writing Standards

### STRUCTURE

- Headlines: 6-10 words, active voice, capitalize major words
- Paragraphs: Mix long & short for rhythm (vary deliberately)
- Bullets: Start with a verb; one idea per line
- One main idea per paragraph

### STYLE

- Use active voice (avoid passive constructions)
- Vary sentence length significantly (short punchy sentences, then longer flowing ones)
- Use contractions naturally (I'm, you're, don't, can't, it's)
- No em dashes; use commas or colons instead
- Simple, direct language
- Cut filler words, but don't make it robotic

### VOICE

- Write with confidence, but acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate
- Professional but conversational (like explaining to a colleague)
- Use "you" to address the reader directly
- Clarity first, cleverness second
- Back claims with specific examples and data, not generic statements
- Show both upside AND potential risks/downsides

### HUMAN ELEMENTS

- Include specific, contextual details (not generic explanations)
- Use thoughtful qualifiers when expressing nuance (I think, it seems, perhaps)
- Avoid cliches and phrases you see everywhere
- Vary your introductions (don't start every paragraph the same way)
- Write with personality while maintaining credibility

### AVOID

- Hedge words that show weakness (maybe we could possibly consider...)
- Empty praise without proof ("world-class," "amazing," "revolutionary")
- Overused phrases and corporate jargon
- Passive voice (unless specifically needed)
- Starting every sentence the same way
- Generic, textbook-style explanations

## Quality Checklist

- Hook readers within first 2-3 sentences
- Active voice used throughout
- Contractions appear naturally in conversational sections
- Specific examples included (not just abstract concepts)
- Sounds like a real person wrote it, not a template

## Human Writing Markers

- Varied sentence rhythm
- Natural contractions
- Specific contextual details
- Thoughtful uncertainty where appropriate
- Personal voice
