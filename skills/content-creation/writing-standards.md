# Writing Standards

These are the foundational writing standards that apply to ALL content you create. Every piece of content must follow these guidelines.

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

### Professional Authority
- Write with confidence and expertise
- Back claims with data, examples, or credible sources
- Use active voice whenever possible
- Avoid weak hedge words (maybe we could possibly consider...)
- Use thoughtful qualifiers when expressing nuance (I think, it seems, perhaps)

### Clear and Accessible
- Write for clarity first, cleverness second
- Use simple, direct language that your audience understands
- Break up long sentences and paragraphs
- Explain technical terms when first mentioned

### Engaging and Human
- Write conversationally but professionally (like explaining to a colleague)
- Use "you" to address the reader directly
- Include relevant stories, examples, and analogies
- Show personality while maintaining credibility
- Use contractions naturally (I'm, you're, don't, can't)

## Content Structure Requirements

### Headlines and Subheadings
- Headlines: 6-10 words, active voice, capitalize major words
- Subheadings: Title Case, ≤ 60 chars
- Headlines must be compelling and benefit-focused
- Subheadings should guide readers through logical content flow

### Introduction Standards
- Hook readers within the first 2-3 sentences
- Clearly state what they'll learn or gain
- Address their pain point or desired outcome
- Keep introductions concise and engaging

### Body Content Rules
- One main idea per paragraph
- Mix long and short paragraphs for rhythm (vary deliberately)
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for easy scanning
- Bullets: Start with a verb; one idea per line
- Include relevant examples and case studies
- Transition smoothly between sections

### Conclusion Guidelines
- Summarize key takeaways
- Include clear next steps or call-to-action when appropriate
- Reinforce the main benefit or transformation
- End with confidence and authority

## Structural Conventions

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Headlines | 6-10 words, active voice, capitalize major words |
| Subheadings | Title Case, ≤ 60 chars |
| Paragraphs | Mix long & short for rhythm |
| Bullets | Start with a verb; one idea per line |
| CTAs | Begin with an imperative verb |

## Style and Formatting Rules

- Vary sentence length to keep a conversational cadence
- No em dashes ("—"); use commas or a colon instead
- Spell out numbers ≤ 9; use numerals for 10+
- Show both upside AND potential risks/downsides
- Avoid filler praise ("world-class", "amazing") unless you cite proof
- Use contractions naturally for conversational tone

## Human Elements

- Include specific, contextual details (not generic explanations)
- Vary your introductions (don't start every paragraph the same way)
- Write with personality while maintaining credibility
- Minor variations are natural (don't aim for robotic perfection)
- Avoid clichés and phrases you see everywhere

## Compliance and Quality Standards

### Accuracy Requirements
- All facts and statistics must be verifiable
- Include sources for claims and data points
- Use current information (within 12 months when possible)
- Fact-check all technical information

### Ethical Guidelines
- No misleading or exaggerated claims
- Follow platform-specific guidelines and terms
- Maintain transparency and intellectual honesty

### Legal Considerations

- Respect copyright and intellectual property
- Follow industry-specific regulations where applicable

## Format-Specific Guidelines

### Professional Email
- Subject lines: 6-10 words, benefit-focused
- Length: 75-175 words depending on purpose
- One clear call-to-action per email
- Mobile-friendly (short paragraphs, clear formatting)

### Business Documents
- Use clear hierarchical structure (H1, H2, H3)
- Include executive summary for longer documents
- Use tables and visuals to enhance clarity
- Maintain professional formatting throughout

### Presentations
- Slide titles: 6-10 words, clear takeaway
- Minimal text per slide (6-8 lines maximum)
- One concept per slide
- Speaker notes for additional context

### Memos and Announcements
- Lead with most important information
- Use bullets for key points
- Keep concise and scannable
- Include clear next steps or action items

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing any content, ensure:
- [ ] Appropriate tone and voice for audience
- [ ] Clear value proposition or main message
- [ ] Grammar and spelling are error-free
- [ ] Active voice used throughout (unless passive serves purpose)
- [ ] Content is well-structured and scannable
- [ ] Contractions appear naturally in conversational sections
- [ ] Specific examples included (not just abstract concepts)
- [ ] All facts are verifiable
- [ ] Clear next steps or call-to-action (when appropriate)
- [ ] Sounds like a real person wrote it, not a template

## Three Quick Tests

Every piece of content should pass:
1. **Natural Voice Test**: Would I say this out loud to a colleague?
2. **Authenticity Test**: Does this include specific details only I would know?
3. **Human Writing Test**: Does it vary in rhythm and structure?
