### Example: Policy Change Memo

```
TO: Engineering Team
FROM: [Your Name], Director of Enterprise Applications
DATE: January 15, 2026
RE: New Remote Work Policy – Effective February 1

Starting February 1, we're implementing a hybrid work model requiring three days
per week in the office (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday).

**Why This Change**

After analyzing team collaboration patterns and project delivery metrics, we found
that in-person collaboration on our core work days significantly improves:
• Cross-team coordination (30% faster resolution on complex issues)
• Onboarding effectiveness (new hires ramp 40% faster)
• Knowledge sharing and mentorship opportunities

**How It Works**

• Required in-office days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
• Flexible days: Monday and Friday (remote or office, your choice)
• Core hours: 10 AM - 3 PM on in-office days
• Exceptions: Coordinate with your manager for special circumstances

**What You Need to Do**

1. Review the detailed policy document (link in follow-up email)
2. Discuss any conflicts with your manager by January 25
3. Plan your schedule for February 1 start

**Questions?**

Your managers have the full FAQ document. Contact me directly for policy
clarifications.

This change helps us balance flexibility with the collaboration that makes our
team effective. Thank you for adapting to this new approach.
```

**Why it works**:
- Clear subject line with effective date
- Opens with the main point
- Explains rationale with data
- Bullets make details scannable
- Specific action items with deadlines
- Acknowledges impact on team
