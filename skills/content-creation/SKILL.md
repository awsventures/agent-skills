# Content Creation Skill

Professional content creation templates for business communications, technical documents, and presentations. This skill uses a structured approach inspired by Trevor Longino's instant-marketing-mastery framework, adapted for general professional content.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to create:

**Communications**:
- Professional emails (outreach, follow-up, announcements, updates)
- Memos (policy, project updates, team communications, decisions)
- Announcements (organizational changes, initiatives, achievements)

**Documents**:
- Reports (status, analysis, incident, performance)
- Proposals (project, budget, process improvement, technology)
- Documentation (technical, how-to guides, API docs, runbooks)

**Presentations**:
- Slide content (executive updates, proposals, deep dives, training)
- Talking points (presentations, meetings, interviews, media)

## How This Skill Works

This skill follows a three-part structure:

### 1. Global Writing Standards
All content follows the writing standards defined in `writing-standards.md`, which combines:
- Classical writing principles (clarity, brevity, active voice)
- Human-sounding elements (contractions, specific details, varied rhythm)
- Professional business communication best practices

### 2. Content-Type Templates
Each template includes:
- Specifications for that content type
- Detailed prompts to gather information
- Quality checks to ensure standards are met
- Example outputs showing what works

### 3. Execution Process
When you request content:
1. I'll ask clarifying questions (based on the template's prompt section)
2. You provide specific details about your needs
3. I create content following the writing standards and template specifications
4. I apply quality checks before delivery

## Key Principles

This skill emphasizes:

**Clarity Over Cleverness**: Direct, understandable language
**Specificity**: Concrete examples and data, not generic statements
**Professionalism**: Credible and polished, but approachable
**Human Voice**: Natural contractions, varied rhythm, conversational tone
**Action-Oriented**: Clear next steps and outcomes
**Audience-Focused**: Written from reader's perspective

## Writing Standards Summary

All content created with this skill follows these core standards:

**Structure**:
- Headlines: 6-10 words, active voice
- Paragraphs: Mix long and short for rhythm
- Bullets: Start with verbs, one idea per line
- One main idea per paragraph

**Style**:
- Active voice (avoid passive constructions)
- Varied sentence length
- Natural contractions (I'm, you're, don't, can't)
- Simple, direct language
- Cut filler words without sounding robotic

**Voice**:
- Confident but acknowledges uncertainty when appropriate
- Professional yet conversational
- Backs claims with specific examples and data
- Shows both benefits AND potential risks

**Human Elements**:
- Specific, contextual details
- Thoughtful qualifiers (I think, it seems, perhaps)
- Varied introductions and sentence structures
- Personality while maintaining credibility

## How to Request Content

Simply ask for what you need. For example:

- "Write a professional email to [audience] about [topic]"
- "Create a proposal for [project/initiative]"
- "Draft a memo about [subject] for my team"
- "Help me write an announcement about [news]"
- "Create slides for a presentation on [topic]"
- "I need talking points for [meeting/presentation]"

I'll automatically:
1. Select the appropriate template
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Create content following writing standards
4. Apply quality checks
5. Provide the final content with brief explanation

## Credits and Inspiration

3. Execution templates

Adapted for general professional content with enhanced human-writing elements based on:
